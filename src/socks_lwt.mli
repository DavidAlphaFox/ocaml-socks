val easy_establish_server : unit -> Lwt_io.server Lwt.t
(** [easy_establish_server ()] is a local proxy server that listens on

    RFC 1929 Username/Password authentication and uses [auth_cb] to validate the
    username/password combination received from the client.

    Note that for SOCKS4{_ A} clients the username is offered as a potential
    authenticator (with an empty password string, since SOCKS 4{_ A} does not
    support password authentication).

(** {2:writing_an_auth_policy Writing an authentication policy} *)
(** See {!auth_policy} for a brief explanation of authentication policies.

    The implementation for {!auth_username_password} looks roughly like this:

    fun method_selection_request ->
    if List.exists (function
                    | Username_password _ -> true

(** {2:testing_your_server Testing connections to your server} *)
(** I found it useful to test making various connections to the server,
    here are some command examples:

    - SOCKS 4{_ A}: Domain-name ATYP:[
    socat -v - socks4a:127.0.0.1:localhost:9000]
    - SOCKS 4{_ A}: Domain-name ATYP with username "hello":[
    socat -v - socks4a:127.0.0.1:localhost:9000,socksuser=hello]
    - SOCKS 4{_ A}: Domain-name ATYP containing IP address:[
    socat -v - socks4a:127.0.0.1:127.1.2.3:9000]
    - SOCKS 5: IPv4 ATYP with username "hello":[
