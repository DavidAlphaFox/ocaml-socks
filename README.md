===========

SOCKS4a library for ocaml clients and servers
---------------------------------------------

This library implements functions for parsing and generating SOCKS4A `CONNECT` headers (the current version does not handle `BIND` since I haven't seen that in use anywhere).

### Resources

The protocol description is included in this repository in the files [SOCKS4.protocol.txt](./docs/SOCKS4.protocol.txt) and [SOCKS4A.protocol.txt](./docs/SOCKS4A.protocol.txt) for SOCKS4 and the 4A extension, respectively.
